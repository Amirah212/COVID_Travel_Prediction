# COVID_Travel_Prediction

### Final Project for Columbia Bootcamp

## Question:
In a country where majority of the population is vaccinated, will there be an uptick in travel? Will international travel out of major cities such as NYC follow the same trend as countries like Israel, which has had a successful vaccine roll out?

## Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean and explore the data.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, integrating Flask as a means to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we will be using to create a classifier. We will be modeling our data using a linear regression model.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js and plotly for a  functioning dashboard. It will be hosted on S3.


Baseline: Israel and NYC, USA

Focus: International airplane travel following vaccination.
